    <h1>What is Traversing?</h1>
    <p>jQuery traversing, which means "move through", are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their relation to other elements. Start with one selection and move through that selection until you reach the elements you desire.</p>
    <p>The image below illustrates an HTML page as a tree (DOM tree). With jQuery traversing, you can easily move up (ancestors), down (descendants) and sideways (siblings) in the tree, starting from the selected (current) element. This movement is called traversing - or moving through - the DOM tree.</p>

    <h4>Illustration explained:</h4>
    <li>The div element is the parent of ul, and an ancestor of everything inside of it</li>
    <li>The ul element is the parent of both li elements, and a child of div</li>
    <li>The left li element is the parent of span, child of ul and a descendant of div</li>
    <li>The span element is a child of the left li and a descendant of ul and div</li>
    <li>The two li elements are siblings (they share the same parent)</li>
    <li>The right li element is the parent of b, child of ul and a descendant of div</li>
    <li>The b element is a child of the right li and a descendant of ul and div</li>
    </div>
